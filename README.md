  <h2>Random Walk Visualization with Matplotlib</h2>
  <p>This repository contains Python code for visualizing random walks using Matplotlib.</p>
  1. This repository contains Python code for visualizing random walks using Matplotlib. <br>
  2. The file uses Plotly for visualization.<br>
  3. A random walk is a mathematical concept where a point moves randomly in a sequence of steps. The visualization showcases random walks in 2D. <br>

  <h2> Installation </h2>
  1. Clone this repository. <br>
  2. Ensure you have Python 3.6 or later installed.<br>
  3. Install the required packages: <br>
      <i>pip install scipy seaborn matplotlib</i>

  <h2>Usage</h2>
  Choose either of the following files for visualization: <br>
  1. You can open the file from Jupyter Notebook and run to see the results

  <h2>Bonus - Sierpinski Triangle</h2>
  The file also has the code for Sierpinsiki Triangle with n steps. you can change the value of n to 1000 to 100K and see for yourself. <br>
  The Sierpiński triangle, also known as the Sierpiński gasket or Sierpiński sieve, is a fascinating fractal with the overall shape of an equilateral triangle. It’s subdivided recursively into smaller equilateral triangles
